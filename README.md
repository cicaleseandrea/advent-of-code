# Advent of Code
My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions.


## Goals
- have fun
- have fun
- learn something new
- [solve as many puzzles as possible within the time limit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7m9mg8/all_years_all_days_solve_them_within_the_time/)
- try out (and overuse) the following Java features: `Lambda`, `Stream`,
  `Optional`, `var`, 
  [switch expressions](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/325)


## Requirements
The project uses java 13 with *preview features*.

You will need JDK 13. By default the project will look for it in `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-13.0.1.jdk/Contents/Home`

You can also specify your own JDK path like this when using gradle:

`./gradlew <command> -Dorg.gradle.java.home=/path/to/java13`

## Run Unit Tests
Run all tests:

`./gradlew clean test`

Run a specific year:

`./gradlew clean test --tests *2019*`

Run a specific day:

`./gradlew clean test --tests *132019*`


## Enable printing to `stdout`
Print a representation of some puzzles to `stdout`:

`./gradlew clean test -Dprint=true`


## Enable interactive mode
Following days have a `main` method that enables a basic interactive mode:
- 13th December 2019
- 25th December 2019

Enjoy! üïπÔ∏è
